It's not obvious when I'm in dangerous
 - Bring back screen fading
 - Add suffocating sounds
 - Add suffocating music


Music is too loud
 - Add volume Slider
 - Add multiple volume sliders
 - Do a comprehensive pass over all sounds to get volumes correct


Diver gets stuck on walls
 - Try merging adjacent tiles? This seems hard


It's too easy
 - Bring back the health system
 - Add in enemies again


Rapid resurfacing and unsurfacing when at surface
 - Should have the equilibrium point for floating on the surface be different than the point for determining if we're surfaced
 - We need diver.isSurfaced and diver.headAboveWater

Can't navigate menus with a gamepad
