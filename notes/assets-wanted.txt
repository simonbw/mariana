Sprites
 - Ground tilesets
   - Finish the existing rock tileset with the new corners
   - More tilesets for more biomes would be cool
   - Tiles can have an emmissive layer if you want

 - Seaweed
   - Should be straight up-and-down to be bendable
   - I'm gonna deform it with a mesh to make it wiggle
   - Various types is good

 - Jellyfish
   - Animated movement, see my crappy programmer art for keyframes
   - At least the frames that exist in the example now, more in between would be better
   - Glow layers and transparency would be cool

 - Shark
   - Remove/change blood dripping (The dripping is cool but doesn't work well at a low frame rate)
   - Separate frames/animation for idle vs aggroed
   - A couple frames for a biting animation

 - Oxygen buoy thing

 - Coral reef fauna
   - acropora humilis
   - acropora cervicornis
   - heliopora coerulea
   - diploria labyrinthiformis
   - dendrogyra cylindrus
   - gorgonia ventalina
   - urticina eques
   - echinometra viridis
   - paracentrotus lividus
  
 - Coral reef fish
   - Just a lot sprites to bring life to the coral reef
   - Single frame fish work, but 2-4 swimming frames is better
   - Some ideas:
