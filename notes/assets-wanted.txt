Sprites

 - Ground tilesets
   - Finish the existing rock tileset with the new corners
   - More tilesets for more biomes would be cool
   - Tiles can have an emmissive layer if you want

 - Seaweed
   - Should be straight up-and-down, the engine will do the bending
   - I'm gonna deform it with a mesh to make it wiggle
   - Multiple variants could be good
   - Can have extra sprites for leaves at the base or along it

 - Soul Plant
   - The plant that grows fish souls, could use a Redesign
   - Could also use a few variants

 - Redesign Jellyfish
   - Animated movement, see my crappy programmer art for keyframes
   - At least the frames that exist in the example now, more in between would be better
   - Glow layers and transparency would be cool

 - Shark
   - Remove/change blood dripping (The dripping is cool but doesn't work well at a low frame rate)
   - Separate frames/animation for idle vs aggroed
   - A couple frames for a biting animation

 - Dive bell

 - Coral reef fauna
   - acropora humilis
   - acropora cervicornis
   - heliopora coerulea
   - diploria labyrinthiformis
   - dendrogyra cylindrus
   - gorgonia ventalina
   - urticina eques
   - echinometra viridis
   - paracentrotus lividus
  
 - Coral reef fish
   - Just a lot sprites to bring life to the coral reef
   - Single frame fish work, but 2-4 swimming frames is better
   - Some ideas:
     - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef_fish
     - Angelfish
     - Blue Tang (think Dory)
     - Butterflyfish
     - Damselfish
     - Goby
     - Seahorse
     - Surgeonfish
     - Yellow Tang
 
 - Upgrade icons

 - Bigger boat
   - Needs more pixels
   - Could have a hanging lamp (or multiple) that swings with the motion of the ocean <- just seems like it would be a cool effect.
   - Can have glow layer for turning on the lights inside at night
   - Maybe 
 
 - Redesign diver
   - Separate layers for arms to be able to aim with harpoon
   - Maybe some animations
   - Have lights on him
   - Separate out the harpoon gun
 
 - Harpoon
   - Separate sprite for the harpoon and the harpoon gun
   - Maybe a loaded and unloaded harpoon gun sprite
   - Maybe different harpoon images based on upgrades
