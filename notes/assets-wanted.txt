Sprites
 - Ground tilesets
   - Finish the existing rock tileset with the new corners
   - More tilesets for more biomes would be cool
   - Tiles can have other layers for bioluminescence if you want

 - Seaweed
   - Should be straight up-and-down
   - I'm gonna deform it with a mesh to make it wiggle

 - Shark
   - Remove/change blood dripping (The dripping is cool but doesn't work well at a low frame rate)
   - Separate frames/animation for idle vs aggroed
   - A couple frames for a biting animation

 - Coral reef fauna
   - 
  
 - Coral reef fish
   - Just a lot sprites to bring life to the coral reef
   - Single frame fish work, but 2-4 swimming frames is better
 - 
 - Moving squidger thing
 - Upgrade icons
