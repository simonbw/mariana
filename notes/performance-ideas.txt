 General

Cache V2ds
 - There's a lot of performance to be gained by reducing allocations/collection of V2d's
 - Replace default getPosition() with cached version

Reduce stuff done in `onTick`
 - Try to move stuff to onSlowTick
 - Try to move stuff to event handlers

 Physics 
—————————

Allow marking non-particle bodies as "particle"

Eel
 - Can we use fewer bodies, and just interpolate for the mesh?

Do screen-to-world conversion in vertex not fragment Shader

Use a different shader for the waves on the surface so that we're not calculating wave heights everywhere
