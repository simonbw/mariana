 General

Cache V2ds
 - Audit all the places where we create new V2ds and see if they can be preallocated

Reduce stuff done in `onTick`
 - Try to move stuff to onSlowTick
 - Try to move stuff to event handlers

Make adding/instantiating entities cheaper
 - don't add filters?

Use faster grid for GroundMap
 - just a 2d array?
 - use structurae

WorldMap
 - conversions without allocating

Bubble
 - ?

Sonar
 - Faster ground map

Fish

 Physics

Allow marking non-particle bodies as "particle"

Eel
 - Can we use fewer bodies, and just interpolate for the mesh?

Do screen-to-world conversion in vertex not fragment Shader

Use a different shader for the waves on the surface so that we're not calculating wave heights everywhere
